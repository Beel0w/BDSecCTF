On Wireshark, if we check all conversation : 
<p align='center'>
![Screenshot](conversation.png)            
</p>
We can see a conversation with 2 ip : 192.168.1.13 and 192.168.1.10 and an important number of bytes.
The main Address A for Conversations Module is 192.168.1.10. It's the attacker. 192.168.1.13 is the server.

The flag Is : `BDSEC{192.168.1.13_192.168.1.10} `
