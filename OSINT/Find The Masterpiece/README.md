# Find The Masterpiece

## Context

>My friend gave me the following stream of numbers and told me to figure out something of it. He gave me a hint that, the thing hidden behind the numbers is very known to me and piano keys might help me to solve the challenge. He also claimed that it is a master piece. So, he also asked for the creation date of that master piece. Please help me to solve that mistery!

## Resolving

To find the masterpiece, I decided to launch Youtube and to search 3566678889775656.
